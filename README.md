[Juno](simplerockets.com) is an awesome simulator where you can build rockets and planes, and fly them pretty much everywhere.
But also write programs (scripts) to automate them. There isn't a unfied platform to share them though, so here we are.

Here are a few programs I built:

### 1. Acend
_v5.4_ ([link to download to Juno](https://www.simplerockets.com/c/3b1t88/M-o-o-s-e-v2-_-ascend-v5-4))

Launches a rocket into a defined orbit. Works on bodies with and without atmosphere.

### 2. Landing
_v1.6_  ([link to download to Juno](https://www.simplerockets.com/c/LZF36n/_-descend-v1-6-program-comes-with-a-booster))

Automatically lands a spacecraft, on bodies with or without an atmosphere.
