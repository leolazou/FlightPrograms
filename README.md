[Juno: New Origins](simplerockets.com) is an awesome simulator where you can build rockets and planes, and fly them pretty much everywhere.
But also write programs (scripts) to automate them. There isn't a unfied platform to share them though, so here we are.

A few programs I built:

### 1. Acend _v5.4_
Launches any rocket and reaches any desired orbit in space. ([link to download to Juno](https://www.simplerockets.com/c/3b1t88/M-o-o-s-e-v2-_-ascend-v5-4))

### 2. Landing _v1.6_
Automatically lands a spacecraft or booster, on bodies with or without atmosphere. ([link to download to Juno](https://www.simplerockets.com/c/LZF36n/_-descend-v1-6-program-comes-with-a-booster))
